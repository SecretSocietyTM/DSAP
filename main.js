// I've decided to scrap all the previous work
//
// I will instead make use of HTML svg instead.
// Doing so will hopefully increase the speed at which I 
// progress in the actual DSA part of the project because 
// at the moment I am spending way too much time just working
// on the graphics / canvas2d part of the project which is 
// a massive waste of time.
//
//
//
// Now I have to go through and learn the svg library more...
// I suppose I can start making a rough design on figma!
